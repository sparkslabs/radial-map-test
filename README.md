# Radial Map

Live demo of the file on github:

* <https://raw.githack.com/sparkslabs/radial-map-test/refs/heads/main/radial_map.html>

## Files:

* radial_map.html - this is the main file. Warts and all
* radar_data.py - helper to create the data to embed in the radial map file

## What is it?

* **An Experimental prototype**

* **A hot mess of sketch quality code that needs refactoring heavily and urgently**

* An experimental prototype for exploring data that can be found on radial
  maps.  This is tested using data from EVERSE TechRadar.

* An answer to the question "what can we do quickly as a bandaid?"

* Lightweight, zero dependencies

* **Pure SVG** generated by JS meaning **the SVG can be extracted and used in documents** if wanted. (Could also be later generated for download)

* Motivated by EVERSE TR, but not specific to it.

Focusses on look and feel for exploring some data. This doesn't tell you if it's useful in your domain, nor whether you should use it. There are usability issues near the centre especially, so caveat coder.

## Capabilities

* It renders the radial map completely before the fold - so users won't click away

* It allows for a heading and text to be placed next to the radial map so people can be told what they're looking at rather have to click away to a separate "what is this/how to use this" page.

* Almost entirely data driven. (Not entirely yet :-( )

* Copies as much look and feel of the original radar as practical

* It renders the tool names onto the radial map so people don't have to play minesweeper (Except near the middle)
  * However, tool labels will always crowd in the middle oLabelsf this design, so when you hover over dots the labels rise to the top and turn white
  * When clicking on tool labels, they take you to the current tech radial map pages.
  * It has deterministic placement of labels within a chunk (seg/ring co-ord)

* Zoom modes:
  * It has a zoom mode to enable the radial map to take up the full screen width - making it more explorable.
  * The deterministic nature of label placement means that if you click inside a chunk, it zooms it revealing all the dots (even overcrowded chunks) in the same placement
  * You can also click on a segment name and see all the tools (labels) at a glance there for a given segment - with chunks in order and tools in with the same placement.
  * The chunk and segment zoom work whether the main radial map is zoomed or not.

* Looks reasonable both at 1920x1080, but also lower res displays - like 1280x720

Is this good ? No. It's a band-aid at best. The crowding in the middle, leading back to minesweeper interface demonstrates the interface style is a bad idea. Flipping to a Cartesian map rather than radial would be relatively trivial with this, since it'd just be re-rendering all the chunks. 

This brings us onto Caveats below.

## Screenshots

Some idea of what my redone version looks like (1920x1080 screen res)

### Normal mode:

![Default view on 1920x1080 display][default_view]

###  Zoom Mode

Click outside circle to enter/exit.

![Zoomed view][expanded_view]

###  Segment View

Zoom on segment - click on segment label - which highlights as a link when hovering.

![An expanded segment after clicking on label][segment_view]

###  Chunk View

Zoom on chunk: (click on white space in chunk - the chunks lighten on mouse over to hint at functionality)

![Clicking on a chunk shows things with deterministic positioning][chunk_view]

### Minesweeper Issue:

Highlighting this does still leave a minesweeper problem near centre:

![Note the clear minesweeper effect][closeup_view]

## Context

### LICENSE: APACHE 2

### Dependencies: None

Just load up in a browser and this should work for you.

## Caveats

### Broken remote links

The links into the EVERSE tech radar are currently broken - this is because that site is under active development!

### Status: This code is *sketch quality*

### AI Assistance note:

Is the result of long by tight conversation with an LLM about building this
up from first principles.  The code quality is therefore "OK at best".

(Assisted/tightly directed, not vibe coded)

### What "needs" doing (Serious issues preventing use by others)

It is not ready to be integrated into anyhing else, the following needs to
happen:

* It needs refactoring - the code has duplication and mixed concerns all
  over the place.

* While data driven, that needs improving significantly. (It's almost entirely data structure driven, but not quite)

* There's no information hiding, so it needs a module interface wrapping on
  top if this is to be used in something else.

* Better seperation of concerns:
  * Far too many unconstrained random repeated constants (from exploring what works).
  * Better /single placement module (eg vs mixed with SVG)

**Highly Desirable**

* Alternate projection  - Cartesian rather than Polar - should be trivial using the existing segment/chunk code, but would be really useful.

**Other: (would be nice)**

  * Better behaviour layer
  * Ring spacing tweaks
  * option to export as SVG
  * Animation (if useful)
  * Reconsideratiom of layout.

Suggested estimate time worth on this: around 0.5 - 1 days' work. (Uncertainty factor 1.5 - 4)
